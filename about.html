        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am Manjusri, a second-year B.Tech student in Information Technology at the Knowledge Institute of Technology, Salem. I have a strong passion for learning new technologies, with a particular focus on web development. Designing web pages that are both creative and functional excites me, and I strive to create unique, user-friendly experiences that stand out.<br>

            My technical expertise centers around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am continuously improving my skills in these areas. I also enjoy experimenting with responsive design and ensuring that my projects are accessible to all users. Web development provides me with the perfect blend of creativity and problem-solving, <br>and I take pride in developing solutions that are not only visually appealing but also efficient.
            
            In addition to my academic work, I have participated in several national-level technical symposiums, earning recognition for paper and poster presentations. These experiences have further fueled my passion for technology and helped me grow both personally and professionally.<br>
            
            As I continue my journey in the field of IT, my goal is to secure a placement in a company where I can apply my skills, learn new technologies, and contribute to meaningful projects. I am eager to embrace new challenges and am confident in my potential to excel in the ever-evolving world of web development.</p>
